> This is the old stable template-only release of PyAction and not being updated anymore. I offer the latest updated release instead.

PyAction is a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.io) template that allows you to develop custom [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) using [Python3](https://python.org/).

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> Read ["Writing GitHub Actions in Python"](https://imsadra.me/writing-github-actions-in-python) article that walks you through a hello-world example. -->

### Installation
Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed on your machine and install the `cookiecutter` package. That's the template generator tool.

```sh
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

### Usage
In order to create the template, run the following command.

```sh
cookiecutter gh:lnxpy/pyaction -c template
```

Answer the prompts and your template will be generated.
