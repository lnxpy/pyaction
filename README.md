PyAction helps you to develop [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) using Python. It's delivered as an installable package with the ability to test the action locally before any deployment.

```python
from pyaction import PyAction


workflow = PyAction.workflow()


@workflow.action()
def greetings_action(name: str, age: int) -> None:
    workflow.write(
        {
            "phrase": f"Hello {name}. You are {age}!"
        }
    )

# $ pyaction run
# ┏━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
# ┃ Variable ┃          Value          ┃     Type      ┃           Workflow Usage            ┃
# ┡━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
# │  phrase  │ Hello Jane. You are 20! │ <class 'str'> │ ${{ steps.STEP_ID.outputs.phrase }} │
# └──────────┴─────────────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
